# 32-bit RISC CPU Based on ARM Architecture

This project presents the **design and implementation of a 32-bit RISC CPU inspired by the ARM architecture**, using Verilog HDL. The processor is non-pipelined and uses a simplified ARM-like instruction set, making it ideal for understanding the fundamental concepts of processor architecture, datapath control, and instruction execution.

## üéØ Project Objective

The goal is to build a custom 32-bit ARM-style RISC processor with:

- A minimal yet powerful instruction set
- Clear separation of controller and datapath
- Modular design using RTL (Register Transfer Level) Verilog
- Simulation-ready and synthesizable design
- Educational clarity and simplicity for VLSI learners

---

## üß† Key Features

- 32-bit data path width
- Controller-datapath architecture using FSM control
- 16 general-purpose registers (R0‚ÄìR15)
- ALU supporting core arithmetic and logic operations
- Support for condition flags: Zero (Z), Negative (N), Carry (C), Overflow (V)
- Instruction formats modeled on ARM instruction styles
- Memory-mapped I/O support for LDR and STR
- Verified using Verilog testbenches

---

## üîÅ Supported Instruction Set

The following subset of ARM instructions is implemented:

### üßÆ Data Processing
- `ADD` ‚Äì Add
- `SUB` ‚Äì Subtract
- `AND` ‚Äì Bitwise AND
- `ORR` ‚Äì Bitwise OR

### üì¶ Memory Operations
- `LDR` ‚Äì Load from memory
- `STR` ‚Äì Store to memory

### üß≠ Branch
- `B` ‚Äì Unconditional branch

These instructions follow ARM‚Äôs RISC philosophy ‚Äî fixed-length 32-bit instructions, register-to-register computation, and a load/store memory model.

## üõ†Ô∏è Tools & Technologies

- **HDL**: Verilog
- **Simulation**: ModelSim / Icarus Verilog
- **Optional Synthesis**: Xilinx Vivado (for FPGA mapping)
- **Target Audience**: Undergraduate VLSI & digital design students

---

## üîç How It Works (Simplified Flow)

1. **Instruction Fetch** from Instruction Memory
2. **Decode & Control Signal Generation**
3. **Execute using ALU or Branch Logic**
4. **Memory Access (only for LDR/STR)**
5. **Write Back to Register File**

All stages are coordinated using an FSM-based control unit.
